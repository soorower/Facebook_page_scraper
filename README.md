How it will scrape:
1. fb_page_links.py file will ask: 
                 - A facebook page link
                 - Your facebook email
                 - Your facebook password( don't worry its protected )
                 - How many times do you want to scroll. Suppose, you set 100 scroll, then it will scrape 100 to 110 recent posts "links".
                 - If you want to scrape the full "page", you can un-comment out the below code line 92-110. Then comment out the previous scrolling(the upper 9 line codes)

Then the script will go to www.facebook.com, login, then open that page. Then it will start to scrolling. After scrolling it will hover over the "time posted" to reveal the post links.

When finished it will save all the links in an excel(post_links.xlsx)
